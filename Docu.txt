Real Life data:
Input-->
1) 4 runway, 2 way each, can use 1 lane at a time for each runway
2) 1000 vehicles
3) time 24 hours(1000ms = 1s)

Simulation Data:
Input-->
1) 4 runway, 2 way each, can use 1 lane at a time for each runway
2) 167 vehicles
3) time 4 hours(100ms = 1s)
Output-->
1) Which time, which road


[N.B: Take off or landing is random and
	let, Take off time = landing time]
