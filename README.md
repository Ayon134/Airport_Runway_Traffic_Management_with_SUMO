# Airport_Runway_Traffic_Management_with_SUMO
This is a project for CSE474 (Simulation)
We have taken Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport as our vision.

# How to run?
In order to run and see whats hapenning just install SUMO simulator and run the .cfg file suing SUMO GUI. 

# Variable
1. Number of plane on runway
2. Number of plane on air want to land
3. Number of plane on request to takeoff next
Unfortunately, we could not get a good dataset so we created by ourselves

# What is happening?
1. We have taken Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport as our vision, there 2500 planes can takeoff or land in any regular day and it has 4 runways
2. So, technically in every 2min 30 sec a plane take off or land in this airport. Keepinh this in mind we created a dataset.
3. The dataset of runway traffic coud not be found in the time period so we created one considering the number of planes and runway. 
4. 


This project is still under development.
