# Airport_Runway_Traffic_Management_with_SUMO
This is a project for CSE474 (Simulation)
We have taken Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport as our vision.

# How to run?
In order to run and see whats hapenning just install SUMO simulator and run the .cfg file suing SUMO GUI. 

# Variable
1. Number of plane on runway
2. Number of plane on air want to land
3. Number of plane on request to takeoff next
Unfortunately, we could not get a good dataset so we created by ourselves, how?
1. As mentioned, we have taken Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport as our vision, there 2500 planes can takeoff or land in any regular day and it has 4 runways
2. So, technically in every 2min 30 sec a plane take off or land in this airport. Keeping this in mind we created a dataset.
3. In DATASETs folder you will find random.py that generates the csv file as our dataset.
4. The dataset carries few days of plane landing or taking off time in msec.[assuming 100ms = 1sec, just to make things easy]

# What is happening?



This project is still under development.
